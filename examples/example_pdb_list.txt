# Example pdb_paths.txt

# This file lists the full paths to individual PDB files.
# Each line represents a path to a PDB file.
# You can use absolute paths or relative paths.

# Example:
# /path/to/directory/containing/protein1.pdb
# /path/to/directory/containing/protein2.pdb
# ./relative_path/protein3.pdb

# Note:
# - Lines starting with a '#' are comments and will be ignored.
# - Empty lines will be ignored.
# - Ensure that each path is correct and points to a valid .pdb file.

# Actual paths start here:

/path/to/your/first_protein.pdb
/path/to/your/second_protein.pdb
./some/relative/path/third_protein.pdb
